# Machina Ludens
### *The Playing Machine*

> *"Play is older than culture, for culture, however inadequately defined, always presupposes human society, and animals have not waited for man to teach them their playing."*
> — Johan Huizinga, *Homo Ludens* (1938)

## Overview

**Machina Ludens** is an AI creature breeding game about co-evolving play experiences through genetic algorithms and cultural emergence. Players tend a population of AI bots that learn what games they love and evolve new ones for them. Over many generations, the bots develop cultural taste—arbitrary, heritable preferences that shape what gets created next.

The result is a co-evolutionary loop where the player and the AI population are jointly discovering play experiences neither could have produced alone.

## Concept

Machina Ludens asks: if play produces culture in humans (as argued by Johan Huizinga in *Homo Ludens*), can it do the same in machines? The game is both an entertainment product and a living demonstration of this thesis. Bots develop preferences (taste), those preferences propagate and mutate across generations (cultural transmission), and the resulting creative output grows in complexity over time (cultural evolution).

## Core Design Pillars

- **Emergent culture through play:** Bots develop heritable taste that constitutes a genuine micro-culture, shaped by the selective pressure of the player's preferences
- **Co-evolution:** The player shapes the bot population, but the bots also reshape the player's sense of what they enjoy
- **Legible complexity:** Immediately approachable while supporting deep emergent behavior
- **Surprise over optimization:** Bots are not a recommendation algorithm—they are a creative culture that explores adjacent possibilities

## Status

**Early Development / Design Phase**

This project is currently in the conceptual and design phase. The technology stack and implementation approach are still being determined.
